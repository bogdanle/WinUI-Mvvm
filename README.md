# WinUI-Mvvm
Upackaged WinUI C++ app that demonstrates how to implement basic MVVM pattern.
Significantly more challenging than in C# (roughly 5x harder), so do it only if you either need to heavily interact with Windows API or you need to maintain small package/fast startup times/low memory footprint in your app.

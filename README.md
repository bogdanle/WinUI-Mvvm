# WinUI-Mvvm
Upackaged WinUI C++ app that demonstrates how to implement basic MVVM pattern.
Significantly more challenging than in C# (roughly 5x harder), so do it only if you either need to heavily interact with Windows API or you need to maintain small package/fast startup times/low memory footprint in your app. 
# Build instructions
Clone the repo and open the solution in Visual Studio 2026 (2022 should also work fine). You must have 'Desktop Development with C++' workload installed. That's it.  <br>
Note - when you get an exception at startup - ignore it. It's just the unpackaged app thing, nothing to worry about.  <br>
